remediation=The database is designed for day to day operations, as well as limited time storage. If extra storage or faster searching is needed, consider moving the events to an AlienVault Logger

remediation=IDM events identify assets and users in the monitored network. Currently the amount of IDM entries triples the amount of events in the database, which could mean that some of the active IDM plugins are not working properly
