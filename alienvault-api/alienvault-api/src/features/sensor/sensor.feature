Feature: Sensors operations
  As an API client
  I want to be able to verify all sensor operations


    Scenario: Get sensor list and verify against data from database
    Given I set username and password to ghost administrator
    And I log into the ossim API using "https://127.0.0.1:40011/av/api/1.0/auth/login"
    When I send a GET request to url "https://127.0.0.1:40011/av/api/1.0/sensor"
    Then The http status code must be "200"
    And JSON response has key "status" and value equals to string "success"
    And JSON response has key "data.sensors"
    And JSON response key "data.sensors" match ossim sensors table

    Scenario: Select a random sensor  and retrieve the sensor interfaces
    Given I set username and password to ghost administrator
    And I log into the ossim API using "https://127.0.0.1:40011/av/api/1.0/auth/login"
    And I select a random uuid for sensor and store in variable "s_uuid"
    And I make url with paths and store it in variable "url"

    When I send a GET request to url stored in the variable "url"
    Then The http status code must be "200"
    #And I print request result
    And JSON response has key "status" and value equals to string "success"
    And JSON response has key "data.interfaces"
    #And JSON response interfaces are in ossim_setup.conf

    Scenario: Get the properties of a unique sensor
    Given I set username and password to ghost administrator
    And I log into the ossim API using "https://127.0.0.1:40011/av/api/1.0/auth/login"

    And JSON response has key "data.sensor"
    And JSON response properties are equal to sensor with uuid in variable "s_uuid"
