BASE Basic Installation

   These are generic installation instructions.
Prerequisite configurations/software installations
These software requirements are for BASE alone not for SNORT or any specific database software
These requirements are external to the BASE system

These requirements are on the BASE system
3. webserver - must exist on the system running BASE
*BASE 1.x is supported on the following webservers
   -  Package:      Apache Server

**Instructions for these webservers is contained lower in this INSTALL guide
***BASE 1.x may work with other webservers that support PHP but have not been tested so no authoritative help can be provided for either the install or problems
4. PHP
    Version:      4.0.4+ (5.0+ recommended)
    Description:  Web scripting language

5. pear
    Version:      1.5.3(Should install with PHP server)
    Description:  PEAR is short for "PHP Extension and Application Repository" and provides a structured library of open-source code for PHP users
    Reason:       PHP plugin code distribution and package maintenance 
    Homepage:     http://pear.php.net/
    *Under pear the following packages need to be installed
    
   Image_Graph
    Version:      0.7.2(alpha)
    Description:  A package for displaying (numerical) data as a graph/chart/plot.

   Image_Color
    Version:      1.0.2

*These packages are all installed using pear
ex: pear install Image_Graph-alpha Image_Canvas-alpha Image_Color Numbers_Roman 
** Optional Installation - For the worldmap graphic to be usable within BASE the following two files must be placed into a specific PEAR subdirectory.

world_map6.png
world_map6.txt

The files need to be placed in the ../pear/Image/Graph/Images/Maps/ directory or whereever the PEAR::Image_Graph-0.7.2 library is installed.
And this can be found out by means of 

	pear config-show  | grep "PEAR directory"

Let's say this returns

	PEAR directory                 php_dir          /usr/local/share/pear

then the appropriate directory would be

/usr/local/share/pear/Image/Graph/Images/Maps/

The exact location of these two files is unfortunately hardcoded.
So it cannot be configured by BASE and set to something under the
BASE directory. 

6. ADODB
    Version:      480+
    Description:  database abstraction library for PHP 
    Reason:       Provides extensive portability support such as date and type-handling and portable schema creation

*For instruction on how to install any of the above applications/packages please refer to the webpages referred. We can not maintain instructions here for applications/packages that we are not responsible for.

BASE 1.x Installation:

1. download the latest stable version of BASE 1.x from the sourceforge.net repository (1.3.9 currently)
   http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=103348

2. uncompress the downloaded file to the designated html directory
*The default directories will be discussed later

3. rename the BASE directory from base-1.x.x/ to base/(where x.x refers to the sub-version code and the directory name will uncompress with this name) 

4. Copy the base_conf.php.dist to base_conf.php

5. Basic install requires configuration of key options in the base_conf.php file
	Those options are:
	the path to the BASE files in the webserver/php directory
		$BASE_urlpath = "/base"; 
	the location of the db library files
		$DBlib_path = "/var/www/adodb/ "; 
	the type of database
		$DBtype = "mysql"; 
	the name of the database
		$alert_dbname = "snort";
	the location of the database "localhost" if local or ip/hostname if remote 
		$alert_host = "localhost"; 
	the SQL port the database is listening on
		$alert_port = ""; 
	the username used to access the databae
		$alert_user = "snort"; 
	the password for the username to used to access the database
		$alert_password = "password_from_snort_conf"; 

6. Advanced Configuration - see configuration notes in bas_conf.php file

7. Setup BASE database connection by accessing the BASE webpage

	https://<ip.address>/base
	This will bring up the initial BASE startup banner. By clicking on the setup page link the BASE DB structure (table acid_ag) and the accompanied structures will be created.
	
	The reulting page will log the creation of the DB connectors and any indexing. At the bottom of the page a web link "Main page" leads to the BASE main page where 



   These are webserver specific instructions for generic webserver configurations. If the default webserver has been modified these instructions can not be followed to the letter.

Apache

The default designated html directory for Apache is

/var/www/html


IIS
