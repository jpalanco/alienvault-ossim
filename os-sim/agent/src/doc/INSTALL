  INSTALL
  -------

  As simple as:

      # python setup.py install

  This way, ossim-agent will be installed in /usr/local.

  Also, you can:
  
      # python setup.py install --prefix=/usr

  For a list of all available commands type:

      # python setup.py --help-commands


  Probably you will need python-dev package 
  provided by your favorite distro.


  UNINSTALL
  ---------

  Ossim-agent will be installed in:

    ($prefix)/usr/bin/ossim-agent
    ($prefix)/share/ossim-agent/
    ($prefix)/share/doc/ossim-agent/
    ($prefix)/share/man/man8/ossim-agent.8.gz
    /etc/ossim/agent/

  Just delete these files.


  PACKAGES
  --------

  If you want to create a .tar.gz file, just type:

      # python setup.py bdist

  A binary .tgz package will be created under dist/ directory.

  The same for creating a .rpm file, just typing:

      # python setup.py bdist_rpm
