        * include/classes/Action_email.inc: Fix wrong escape (caused double escape
          on action modifies)

        27 Feb 2006 Alberto Roman <alberto@ossim.net> : All this changes applies to
				ossim server:
        * Cross Correlation: OS & services from host-os-event and host
          service-event events are inserted into host_plugin_sid table to do
          cros correlation. Host Service events now inserts it's ports as
					plugin_sids inside host_plugin_sid. Host OS events inserts the event
					as a different plugin_sid deppending on the S.O. used 
        * Event visibility: Server stores data inside event_tmp table and deletes the older
          regularly. The events will be viewed in a near future thanks to
          "dinamic" framework. You can specify in config table from ossim DB you can put the number of events that
          will be keeped in event_tmp. Server needs restart to re-read that
          configuration (at this time)
				* Server without DB: Multiple changes to let ossim server load without DB.Separate the data loading from DB.
          Now it can send a message to master servers to load data. Mutexes
          used to assure that ossim server won't start working until all the
          data has been loaded
        * Priority & reliability: columns in plugin_sid table can be 0.
        * Removed: fixed asset_src and asset_dst; Now it can be
          modified in children servers and resended to upper ones.
        * Removed: threshold check when qualifying. Not used since long time ago.
        * Logging: Show in the log the remote IP wich has been disconnected
        * Fixed directives: problem with directives and "ANY" keyword in filename, username,
          userdata1... etc. Thx to Selamarjan for the bug report
        * server: sends absolute=false in watch_rules (clarification)
        * BASE64 support: Added to the ossim-server to send certain data over the
          network. Now it's totally safe to send strange characters in the (i.e.)
          description of the plugins_sids or in the plugin name description. The data is
          encoded when sended, and decoded in the reception.
        * Policy: The server now knows how to difference between different policies for
          different "targets", servers or sensors (still some modifications
					needed in the agent to do this). You can tell if a specific server will apply a specific policy.
        * Code: Added sim_strnlen (copied from libc) to let BSD compile
        * Multi level: Added multiple server configuration initial support. Now the Master server (at
          this time, only the primary master server) can
          read data from different servers in database to maintain the state. This
          will be used to configure all the ossim server architecture from a single
          point, without need to setup individually each server. [Some features still
          not implemented, stay tuned! ]
        * Server Role: Assigned different server role for each of the children servers.
        * Risk Assesment: Risk assesment has been changed a bit. Up until now, we divided the
          values by 10, after that we divided it by 2.5 to let de data appear
          correctly. Now, we divide the values directly by 25, so the data is
          automatically adjusted. Now the risk is much more accurate.
        * Default Risk: Modified the default risk to 0. Formerly the event risk was by
          default 1 to be able to print the RRD. If the risk is 0, the RRD can
          paint nothing and it appears ugly. Now that is controlled in the
          Framework; if some risk is 0, it's been changed with a 0.0001 to let
          the Framework paint a line in the RRD.
        * Temporary FIX: -Added temporary hids_event_type accepted for host-hid-_event messages.
          hids_event_type is equivalent to event_type, it stores data in the same place.
        * C&A limited:  Say that the agent and server has been disconnected (server falls down, or
          network is broken some time i.e.). If the event received from the agent, is
          sended to the server more than MAX_DIFF_TIME (60 seconds) after the
          reconnection, the it won't update the C & A and won't do the correlation.
        * ossim_event table:  Added plugin_id & plugin-sid fields
        * FIX: Added IPv6 fix to compile in MAC Tiger (thx Drizzt). 	 

        27 Feb 2007  Tomas V.V.Cox <tvvcox@ossim.net>
        
        * Initial commit of the new event viewer for the Snort DB (it should eventually replace BASE)

        26 Feb 2007 DK <dk@ossim.net> :

          TICKET_HISTORY but reversed :-)

        23 Feb 2007  Tomas V.V.Cox <tvvcox@ossim.net>
        
        * include/classes/: Upgrade.inc, Upgrade_base.inc: New property $snort

          scripts)
        * rc4 upgrade fixes

        22 Feb 2007 DK <dk@ossim.net> :
        * Nessus reporting: when limiting to a single network, only show scan dates where that network was involved.

        21 Feb 2007 DK <dk@ossim.net> :
        * Plugin scheduler: Allow for out-of-schedule scanning.

        * Listener: Allow "scheduling id" as sensor argument in order to reproduce stored scans.

        09 Feb 2007 Alejandro Lopez <alopezp@ossim.net> :
        * Frameworkd: Only update RRD files neccesary and purge old RRD files (1 year old)
          each n iterations in order to increase speed.
        * Frameworkd: Improve Max C&A and level calculation.
        * Frameworkd: Propagate MAX C&A values to bigger time ranges in order to avoid inexact
          values returned from rrdtool AVERAGE.
        * Agent: new Nagios and Heartbeat plugins.
        * Agent: p0f plugin ignore OS version because p0f isn't accurate.
        * Server: ignore OS version, backwards compatibility.

        07 Feb 2007  Tomas V.V.Cox <tvvcox@ossim.net>
        * Fix plugin group displaying (was showing many copies of the same group)

* OSSIM-0.9.9rc3 (22 Sep 2006)

        22 Sep 2006 Alberto Roman <alberto@ossim.net> : All this changes applies to
				ossim server:
        * Increased speed: the preload of symbols is done one time in the beggining not
          with each event.
        * Fixed: problem with a GScanner call in ossim-server
        * Directives: Now you can put the same name to different directives	
        * Added error support for web sessions: If the remote address
          has no permissions to execute something, now it's rejected with an
          error msg
        * Fixed: server <-> sensor disconnect problem. Now it won't
          disconnect machines with the same IP (i.e. a sensor session and a web
          session from the same machine)
        * mysql tables: dissappeared auto_increment in some tables. Now using
          sequences in event and backlog tables
        * Discarding events: If doesn't exists the plugin_id and plugin_sid, don't try to
          do nothing; discard the event.
        * Directives: Added some fields to the "special events" so you can use
           them in directives
           Arpwatch events:
             Userdata1 = MAC
           Pads events:
             Userdata1 = application
             Userdata2 = service
           P0f Events:
             Userdata1 = O.S.
        * Fixed: Someday the host_os, host_mac and host_service events was
          removed from inserting in DB. Now it inserts in their specific tables,
          as well as into the snort table. Thx santiago gonzalez for his help.
        * Monitor requests: Use by default ntop instead tcptrack in directives
        * Fixed: MAC events didn't inserted the vendor, and the MAC's
          was inserted when it shouldn't be.
        * Correlation: Ossim server won't correlate if priority is 0 (this may be
          changed in a near future, take it with care)
 
        22 Sep 2006 David Gil <dgil@ossim.net> :
        * agent: switch to the new message protocol for managing plugins:
          + messages eceived from server:
             sensor-plugin-start
             sensor-plugin-stop
             sensor-plugin-enable
             sensor-plugin-disable
          + messages sent to server:
             plugin-process-started
             plugin-process-stopped
             plugin-process-unknown
             plugin-enabled
             plugin-disabled
        * debian packages: update python packages following the new debian
          python policy.
        * frontend (monitor->sensors, policy->sensors):
          always connect to server before sending any message.
        * frameworkd: many fixes and improvements, thanks to alexlopa!

        18 Sep 2006  Tomas V.V.Cox <tvvcox@ossim.net>
        * www/control_panel/global_score.php: - Show hostnames if they are defined
          in table "host" - Added a leyend
          
        14 Sep 2006  Tomas V.V.Cox <tvvcox@ossim.net>
        * etc/httpd/ossim.conf: IMPORTANT: Certain data intensive parts of ossim
          requires this setting (php_value memory_limit 16M). If the execution of a script is aborted with no
          error message, probably this is the source of the problem.

        14 Sep 2006  Tomas V.V.Cox <tvvcox@ossim.net>
        * www/report/pdfreport.php: - Now graphs access require auth
        
        08 Sep 2006  Tomas V.V.Cox <tvvcox@ossim.net>
        
        * Global Score rewritten.
        
          Main changes are:
        
          - New: Inherited threshold for hosts who belongs to defined networks:
          host -> net -> group -> global
          - Fix: Show all groups
          - New: Groups can be expanded to show networks, and networks to show hosts (no need to
          reload the page)
          - Fix: Max Date calculation in global and group (was comparing with just "<")
          - Fix: Reduced execution time
          - Fix: Reduced num of queries
          - Fix: i18n & urlencoding of new incident link
          - Fix: E_ALL when user didn't have full perms
          - New: More information given about hosts
          - New: Metrics are given in percentage. Mouse over the percentage
          to see      the actual values
          - New: Rows are ordered by metric (this is round(metric / threshold * 100)) and alphabetically

        09 Aug 2006  Tomas V.V.Cox <tvvcox@ossim.net>
        * Fix: was imposible to view all incidents (opened & closed)
          
        9 Aug 2006 Alberto <alberto@ossim.net> : 
        * Events with ";": fixed a problem with a GDA call that made the
          insertion into DB to fail. If there are a ";" inside log, it will
          be replaced with a ","					
        * ossim-server: fixed a server crash when host_os table has a problem 
          and an OS event arrives
        * ossim-server: Fixed another SIM_IS_SESSION() bug.
        * server's config.xml: "resend" keyword (inside rserver) has been deprecated 
          and won't be used anymore
        * Anomalies: - To get the MAC's anomalies inserted in DB, won't be needed 
          anymore to define the host or network inside policy. Still needed for OS
          and Service events.
        * event protocol: If the sensor doesn't issue a protocol, we will
          treat it as "OTHER" although it will be inserted (to be able to
          search it in ACID) as a TCP one.

        02 Aug 2006  Tomas V.V.Cox <tvvcox@ossim.net>
        * Really old ossim versions used
          already the plugin_id 4002-4 (Proftp: login failure). Ensure its
          replacement with the new one (sshd: invalid user)
        * reduced reliability of SHELLCODE
          (from 3 to 1) (change already done in ossim_data.sql)
        
        26 Jul 2006  Tomas V.V.Cox <tvvcox@ossim.net>
        * include/classes/Host.inc: E_ALL

          query per row
        * include/classes/Host_os.inc: Minor code clean-up, added comments

          "0.0.0.0" (all interfaces)
        * Command Line:  Additionally, you can specify with command line the following new things
          -explained with examples-. The command line has precedence over the config.xml file:
												 
            -i 192.168.1.1   <-- IP to bind

          "192.168.1.1,192.168.1.0/24,192.168.1.0-40,ANY,any". 
        * Policy appears again in the OSSIM Menu.
