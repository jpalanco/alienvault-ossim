# This is the main Spade configuration line; it must appear first.
# Here are some options for this line:
# + dest:  the Snort facility that the Spade output should go to
#   (alert, log, or both)
# + statefile:  where Spade's persistant data is stored
# + logfile:  where Spade will store information about its run
# + Xdports,Xdips,Xsips,Xsports: like below but with global application

# This line sets up your Spade homenet.  Set this to the network that is
#   connecting to the larger network at the point Spade is running.
# It is important to configure this line.
# Your networks should be like [10.0.0.0/8,192.168.0.0/16] or space separated

# Turn on some detectors with "spade-detect" lines.  Each of these enables
#   a cetain type of detector for a certain type of packet.  If you start to
#   feel overwhelmed, use Xdports, Xdips, Xsips, and/or Xsports on the lines 
#   below to suppress reports you don't care about, and/or disable some of
#   your detectors these that you care least about.

# This line causes Spade to adjust the reporting threshold for a given
#   detector automatically; repeat it for each detector that you want to apply
#   it to
# Target is the target rate of alerts for normal circumstances
#   (0.01= 1% or you can give it an hourly rate)
# After the first hour (or however long the period is set to with "obsper"),
#   the initially configured reporting threshold is ignored
# To use this, you will need to an option of the form id=<label> to the
#   spade-detect line of the detector you want to be adapted and set
#   id=<label> below to match
# This mode is recommended for users getting started that are using absolute
#   anomaly scores; relative score users might want it as well.
